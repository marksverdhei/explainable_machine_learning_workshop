    "Machine learning has become a powerful tool for predictive data analysis, but modern, state-of-the-art approaches are complex and lack interpretability. In this workshop, we discover how classifiers can be used for data analytics, as well as useful tools to gain extensive insights in data patterns and model decision rules. We will use explaination techniques for both simple and more complex models. \n",
