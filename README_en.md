# Explainable Machine Learning  
A workshop by Markus S. Heiervang in collaboration with `[LI:ST]`: Linjeforeningen for informatikk spr√•kteknologi  
***  
\([Norsk readme tigjengelig her](https://github.com/marksverdhei/explainable_machine_learning_workshop/blob/master/README.md)\)  

In this workshop, we cover methods for inspecting and interpreting a variety of machine learning algorithms. We get familiar with the recently popular python library `SHAP` and learn how to apply the tools it provides on different kinds of data.

### Prerequesites  

As a participant of the workshop, you are expected to have `python 3` and `pip` (or `conda`) installed on your computer.  
All code and coding tasks in this workshop is done using jupyter notebooks, so make sure you have either `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` installed on beforehand as well.  
You can install with these commands:  
`pip3 install jupyter`  
(It is a good idea to run `pip3 install --upgrade pip` to make sure you have the most recent pip version)  
or install it with conda if that's your preferred installer:  
`conda install jupyter`  

Being a comfortable python programmer is advantageous, as well as being familiar with the scientific python stack (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn)  
The workshop is therefore a good fit for students who have taken, or is currently taking a more advanced python course such as IN3110, IN2110, IN3050, etc... (Or equivalent)
